      <P>Basics of HTML</P>
      <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>
      <p>The main parts of HTML elements 
        <ol>
          <li><em>The opening tag</em>: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
          <li><em>The closing tag</em>: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends.</li>
          <li><em>The content</em>: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
          <li><em>The element</em>: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element</li>
        </ol>
